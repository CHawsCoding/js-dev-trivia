# js-dev-trivia

The Goal of this project was to create an interactive and fun trivia game with a timer that tests the users knowlege on basic JavaScript information. 

As the user progresses they are shown a timer displays with how many seconds they have to answer the question. If a question is answered wrong there is a 10 second time penalty. The remaining time at the end is the score.

The final screen reveals the users score and gives them an option to save their high scores to local storage.

## Future Updates

I plan to add more questions for more advanced Javascript topics and a function to randomize the questions asked. 

The CSS still needs a lot of work to be more presentable - I wanted yellow for the JS theme but will probably adjust that to be something easier on the eyes (possible a dark mode).
